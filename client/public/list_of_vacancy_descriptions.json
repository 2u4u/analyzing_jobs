JOB BENEFITS: + You can work from anywhere. No moving for a job involved. If you&#x2019;re happy where you are, stay there. If you&#x2019;re unhappy, move somewhere new. This job will go with you. (If you want to spend a month working from the Italian countryside or in a Scottish pub, more power to you.) + Depending upon the type of work, you&#x2019;ll either get paid a flat rate on a per-project basis or hourly for any clients we have ongoing support with (particularly those for which the scope is ever-evolving). SKILLS &amp; REQUIREMENTS: You should have a solid understanding of WordPress, SASS, CSS, PHP and Javascript. You should have experience coding WordPress themes, from scratch. Other skills: You know how to work with Woocommerce. You&#x2019;re very comfortable working with Advanced Custom Fields. You are comfortable working with third party APIs like Mailchimp or Google&#x2019;s APIs.

At The Good we know what ecommerce leaders really want is to have a website that produces a lot more revenue from their existing traffic. In order to do that, they need to convert more of their website visitors into buyers. The problem is, they don&apos;t know how to get their conversion rate to the next level which makes them feel frustrated and stuck. We believe every ecommerce leader deserves a clear path that helps them realize their website&apos;s true conversion potential. We understand how challenging it can be to take an existing website to its next level, which is why for almost 10 years we have been helping ecommerce sites increase their conversion rates without the need to increase traffic. In fact, we&apos;ve written the book on it: Stop Marketing, Start Selling (https://thegood.com/book). We are proud to be a certified B-Corporation. B Corps are a new type of company that uses the power of business to solve social and environmental problems.
